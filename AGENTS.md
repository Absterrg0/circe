# Circe

Circe is the product shipped from this repository. It adds deterministic voice control, task navigation, multi-node routing, and spoken reports to the T3 coding foundation. Provider CLIs still do the coding work. Circe gives the user one assistant for directing that work across machines.

This fork ships Full, Controller, and Headless as the only Circe capability presets. Full and Controller own speech and control.

## What makes Circe special?

### 1. One product

Circe should feel like one application even when several processes or machines are involved. Full and Controller share one desktop identity and include the speech and control capabilities needed by the main product. Headless is the background execution node.

Do not create duplicate launchers, setup flows, node directories, update authorities, or competing owners for the tray, hotkey, and voice lifecycle.

### 2. Voice must be trustworthy

Spoken control is useful only when it acts on the task the user meant. Circe resolves projects and tasks against real, bounded catalogs. It asks for clarification when names are ambiguous. A model may normalize language later, but it never invents IDs, chooses an ambiguous target, authorizes a tool, or dispatches a command directly.

Keep clarification, confirmation, focus, and correction as typed state. Do not hide routing instructions in provider prompts or treat visible UI attention as authority.

### 3. Remote ready

Nodes own their projects, providers, credentials, workspaces, and event stores. A `ProjectRef` or `TaskRef` stays qualified by its execution node. If that node disconnects, report the disconnection. Never move work to another node silently.

Local, LAN, Tailscale, SSH, relay, and tunnel connections are different routes to the same authenticated node. New work must behave correctly across reconnects, multiple devices, and multiple nodes.

### 4. Performance without compromise

Voice workers, report subscriptions, task lists, and WebSocket traffic can make a coding app feel bad quickly. Disabled voice clients must stay idle. Avoid polling when an event can wake the client. Avoid continuously repainting animations. Keep hot UI paths small and load heavy Circe UI only when needed.

### 5. Open and provider-neutral

Circe is open source. Keep core product behavior inspectable in this repository. Circe works through the existing provider adapters for Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok, and OpenCode. Do not create an Circe-only provider execution path. A provider-specific feature needs an explicit decision for every adapter.

## How to work here

Favor ambitious behavior with a small model. Do not preserve complexity because it already exists, and do not add machinery because it looks reusable. Find the real constraint, then choose the smallest design that makes correct behavior unsurprising.

Read and apply `.agents/skills/unslop/SKILL.md` and `.agents/skills/forward-implementation-first/SKILL.md` on every turn. Keep updates concrete and easy to scan. Lead with what changed or what you are doing. Cut canned phrases, vague claims, and long preambles.

Most work on Circe is performed through Circe itself, often from another machine. Treat live processes, ports, and user data as part of the developer's active environment.

### Do not chase tests

Test chasing is not allowed. When a bug is reported, first capture the exact failure with a negative regression test at the seam where the user-visible behavior goes wrong. That test is evidence, not the whole job. Do not stop after making the one test green, weaken the test, or add a special case that satisfies the repro while leaving the design broken.

Use the repro to find the violated invariant and the deeper architectural cause. Check every caller, entry point, preset, client, provider path, connection mode, and reverse state that shares the behavior. Fix the owning module or contract, then add the smallest set of broader tests that proves the invariant across those paths. A bug is done only when the original test passes and the architecture makes the same class of failure difficult to reintroduce.

## A small glossary

- **Circe** is the only product shipped by this fork.
- **T3** is the name of the inherited coding foundation (orchestration, providers, Git, terminals, approvals, contracts, detailed coding UI). It is legacy vocabulary for code Circe owns, not a separate product or boundary.
- **node** means one running server and the machine, projects, provider credentials, and state it owns.
- **Full** means desktop workspace, local execution, tray, hotkey, and supported speech capabilities.
- **Controller** means desktop control, remote connections, tray, hotkey, and supported speech, without local execution.
- **Headless** means background execution without desktop or voice capability.
- **project** means a node-local workspace record rooted at a directory.
- **thread** means the durable provider conversation and work history for a project.
- **task** means the Circe-facing reference to work in a thread, including its execution node.
- **turn** means one user-to-agent cycle, including follow-up work such as checkpointing and reporting.

## Product ownership

Circe is the sole product shipped from this repository. There is no upstream:
inherited implementations (orchestration, persistence, providers, Git,
terminals, connection infrastructure, coding UI) are Circe code and may be
audited, refactored, optimized, or replaced like any other part of the product.
A request to review the "whole app" or improve performance means everything.

`T3`, `t3code`, `CIRCE_*`, `t3code:*`, and `@circe/*` names still found in
code, storage keys, schemes, and package names are legacy identifiers being
renamed in phases, not a boundary. User-visible copy must say Circe. renames
that break compat (URL schemes, storage keys, package names, D-Bus names,
desktop entry IDs) keep the old identifier working as an alias or migrate
stored state; display names change outright.

There is no pure-T3 build and no upstream merge to preserve. Migration numeric
IDs are shipped IDs. Never renumber them.

## The three ways to hurt yourself

1. **Killing by pattern.** Never use `pkill -f`, `pgrep | kill`, or a PID found by matching a name, path, or worktree string. Kill only a PID captured when you started the process, or a port owner verified through `/proc/<pid>/cwd`.
2. **Writing to the live install.** `~/.circe/userdata` is Circe's real database. Never start a development server against it, open it read-write, or clean it up. `~/.t3` and `~/.jarvis` belong to other products' installs; Circe must never open, migrate, or clean them.
3. **Baking in origins.** Never set `VITE_HTTP_URL` or `VITE_WS_URL` for development. Vite proxies `/api`, `/ws`, `/oauth`, and `/.well-known`; baked localhost URLs break remote clients.

## Hit every applicable path

Before calling user-facing work done, check what the change touches:

- **Presets.** Full, Controller, and Headless are the active presets. Package contents do not grant permission to execute.
- **Entry points.** Chat, the Circe control center, Settings, command palette, keybindings, tray, and voice may reach the same behavior.
- **Clients.** Web and desktop share UI, desktop adds Electron and native voice, and mobile is separate React Native code.
- **Providers.** Circe policy stays provider-neutral and uses the ordinary provider adapters.
- **Contracts.** A wire change requires schema, server, and every affected client to agree.
- **Reverse states.** Add the way out and the way to inspect it. Learned aliases need removal; pairing needs disconnection; pending work needs cancellation.
- **Connections.** Check local, remote, reconnect, multi-device, and multi-node behavior where relevant.
- **Docs.** Put shipped behavior in `docs/user`, architecture in `docs/internals`, runbooks in `docs/operations`, and new domain terms in `docs/internals/glossary.md`.

## Dev servers

- `vp i` installs dependencies. Worktree setup normally runs it for you.
- `vp run dev` starts server and web with worktree-local `.circe` state. Read the actual ports and pairing URL from the `[dev-runner]` output.
- Circe's data directory is `~/.circe`, overridden by `CIRCE_HOME`. `CIRCE_HOME` is a deprecated alias that still resolves to Circe state during the rename; `~/.t3` and `~/.jarvis` are never read or written.
- `vp run dev --share` exposes the development instance over the tailnet. Hand the user the full `pairingUrl`, including its token. Do not configure `tailscale serve` manually.
- If a pairing token was consumed, mint another with `node apps/server/src/bin.ts pair`.
- Stop only processes you started and tracked.

## Test data

An empty database is weak test data. Copy a consistent snapshot into the worktree instead of pointing development at live state.

Use SQLite `VACUUM INTO` against the live database in read-only mode. Put the result under `<worktree>/.circe/userdata`. A plain copy of a live SQLite file is unsafe unless its WAL and SHM files are copied consistently too. Copy state into the sandbox; never symlink the sandbox back to live state.

Bring secrets or settings only when the flow under test needs them.

## Verifying

- Run the smallest proof: `vp test run <files>` for touched tests, plus targeted lint and typecheck for changed packages.
- Do not run repo-wide checks such as `vp check`, `vp run -r test`, or `vp run -r typecheck` unless asked. CI owns the full suite.
- Backend behavior changes need focused tests. Event-sourced async tests wait on typed receipts and worker drains, never sleeps or polling.
- Voice tests can prove protocol wiring, ordering, worker lifecycle, and artifact contents. They cannot prove a real microphone, OS permission, audio routing, or physical key release. Release candidates need the applicable real-device acceptance pass.
- Do not launch browsers, simulators, or other computer-control verification unless the user asks or agrees.

## Pull requests

- Never create a PR unless the developer explicitly asks.
- Use conventional, plain-language titles such as `fix(circe): preserve task focus`.
- Keep one concern per PR. Explain the problem, then the fix.
- UI changes need before/after images. Motion, timing, hotkeys, or voice interaction changes need a short video when they can be captured.
- Do not commit PR-only screenshots or videos to the repository.
- When babysitting a PR, inspect checks and comments newer than the last push. Verify bot findings against the source, fix real problems, and explain false positives. Stop when the latest commit is green.

## Documentation

Most code changes do not need an internal documentation change. Agents can read the code.

- `docs/internals/` is for architectural decisions and their reasons, constraints that span components, and implementation traps that are hard to discover from the source. Before adding a paragraph, ask what a maintainer would get wrong without it. If reading the relevant code answers the question, leave it out.
- Do not document every feature, enumerate fields or methods, narrate control flow, maintain file catalogs, or append PR summaries. Types, tests, and code already record the implementation. The glossary defines shared vocabulary; it is not a feature index.
- When a documented decision or constraint changes, rewrite or remove the affected text. Do not append another account of the new behavior. A new internal page needs a distinct, durable reason to exist.
- `docs/user/` helps users accomplish tasks. Give each major feature a concise section explaining what it does, how to start, and anything unintuitive. Keep user docs in the shipped product's voice, without implementation details or contributor tooling.
- `docs/operations/` holds maintainer setup, release, and debugging procedures. Keep instructions for operating an installed Circe server in the user guides.

## Plans and work artifacts

- Do not commit implementation plans, research notes, or agent scratch files.
- Keep durable architecture and constraints in `docs/internals`, not in a second implementation checklist.
- Track active work in its issue or project item. The merged PR is the implementation record.

## How it works

An Circe request is grounded against real node, project, provider, and task catalogs. The deterministic Director returns a closed control plan. Server-side Circe adapters translate that plan into ordinary typed orchestration commands.

The T3 engine persists events and derives the read model. Provider adapters run the selected CLI. Queue-backed workers handle provider ingestion, checkpoints, and Circe follow-ups. A successful provider result is the task outcome; checkpoint capture is optional bookkeeping and must not replace or suppress that result.

Circe projects bounded live presentations from durable T3 task events to the exact origin interaction. Presentation has no parallel delivery ledger, election, acknowledgement, or replay state. Reconnecting clients inspect the ordinary durable task state instead of replaying speech.

The full vocabulary is in `docs/internals/glossary.md`.

## Where code lives

- `apps/server` owns execution, orchestration, persistence, providers, and the server-side Circe adapters.
- `apps/web` is the React/Vite workspace; `apps/desktop` wraps it with Electron, local execution, tray, hotkey, and native voice integration.
- `apps/mobile` is the separate React Native client.
- `packages/contracts`, `packages/client-runtime`, and `packages/shared` are generic T3 seams.
- `packages/circe-core` and `packages/circe-client-runtime` contain Circe-owned policy and runtime code.
- `.repos` contains read-only references. Never edit or import from it.

## Taste

- Keep orchestration pure, adapters explicit, and UI state derived from typed domain state.
- Prefer inferred types. Avoid `any`, unsafe assertions, and barrel imports.
- Comments explain how a function or boundary is used. Do not narrate individual lines.
- A dropped frame, stale label, false success report, repeated sentence, or lying spinner is a product bug.
- If a rule here conflicts with the task, explain the conflict and get explicit approval before breaking it.
- Do not launch browsers, simulators, or other computer-control verification unless the user asks or agrees.
