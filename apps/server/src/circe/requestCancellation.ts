/**
 * The pre-accept cancellation registry for Circe execute calls. One
 * in-flight request per acceptance key; cancellation aborts the
 * interpretation fiber through ordinary Effect interruption, without
 * touching provider internals.
 *
 * Ownership is a per-call lease: the first track for a key owns the slot
 * and alone may begin, finish, or close it. Concurrent duplicates share
 * the owner's single interpretation result and hold no lease, so a refused
 * duplicate can never clean up the owner's commit. A cancel that lands
 * first aborts interpretation and reports cancelled with no dispatch, ever.
 *
 * The acceptance boundary is the actual dispatch attempt, never the end of
 * interpretation:
 *
 * - `trackPreAccept` runs one interpretation per key. A cancel that lands
 *   first aborts it and reports cancelled with no dispatch, ever. A cancel
 *   that arrives before any track leaves a bounded pre-register tombstone
 *   and answers unknown; the later track consumes it and reports cancelled
 *   without running. Duplicates await the owner's single result instead of
 *   running a second inference: success shares the value (the controller
 *   still cancels the loser so only the owner dispatches), failure replays
 *   the owner's cause truthfully, never cancelled.
 * - `beginCommit` is the single atomic gate before any command is invoked.
 *   Only the owner lease proceeds, exactly once per key; every other
 *   attempt is refused and maps to a cancelled execute result.
 * - `finishCommit` records the typed receipt identity after a dispatch
 *   succeeds, owner only. A cancel that lands mid-commit awaits that
 *   receipt and then reports already-accepted with the exact identity, or
 *   unknown when the commit failed. Success is never claimed pre-receipt.
 * - Anything that settles without dispatching leaves no acceptance record,
 *   so a later cancel answers unknown instead of claiming work that never
 *   ran. A retry after a recorded cancel never runs again; a retry after a
 *   recorded acceptance runs untracked so the existing downstream
 *   idempotency and conflict rules govern unchanged. Failures and fiber
 *   interruptions clean up owner-only with no record, so a retry may run
 *   and a late cancel answers unknown.
 * - No durable ledger: all maps are in-memory and bounded. Evicted keys
 *   answer unknown.
