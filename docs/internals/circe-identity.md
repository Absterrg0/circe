# Circe identity

Circe is the product name and the only name used across visible copy, code, packages, installed identities, and stored data. The earlier split (visible ARIS with reserved Jarvis identifiers) is gone; there is no reserved codename.

## What is Circe

- Display name `Circe`; nightly desktop builds show `Circe (Nightly)`; mobile variants show `Circe Dev`, `Circe Preview`, `Circe`.
- App and bundle IDs: `com.abstergo.circe`, `com.abstergo.circe.dev`, `com.abstergo.circe.preview`.
- Desktop schemes `circe` and `t3-dev`, plus the upstream mobile schemes `t3code`, `t3code-dev`, `t3code-preview`.
- Packages `@circe/core`, `@circe/client-runtime`, `@circe/relay`, in `packages/circe-*`.
- CLI package `@absterrg0/circe` (built from `apps/server`) with the `circe` command and its subcommands (`circe connect`, `circe serve`, `circe service`).
- Data: `~/.circe`, `~/.circe-headless`, `.circe` config paths, `CIRCE_*` environment variables, `circe-resources`, `circe-official-release.json`, `official-circe` and `unified-circe`.
- Release endpoints `https://github.com/Absterrg0/Circe/releases` with artifacts `Circe-${version}-${arch}.${ext}`.
- Migrations keep numeric IDs 41 through 58 and their `Circe*` names.
- Relay resources, Clerk audience, and OTLP variables are Circe-named (`circe-relay`, `CIRCE_RELAY_URL`).

## Legacy T3 names being renamed

There is no upstream. `T3CODE_*` settings, `t3code:*` storage keys, `t3code`
URL schemes, and `@circe/*` package names inherited from the foundation are
legacy identifiers renamed in phases. Compat-sensitive renames (schemes,
storage keys, package names, D-Bus names, desktop entry IDs) keep the old
identifier working as an alias or migrate stored state; display names change
outright. User-visible copy must say Circe.

## Example catalog names

The semantic fixtures use `Beacon` as the example project alongside `Rivvl`. The assistant name is reserved, so an example project must not be named `Circe`: a project named the same as the assistant fuzzy-matches the assistant name during grounding.
