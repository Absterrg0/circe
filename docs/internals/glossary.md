# Glossary

Terms whose meaning matters across T3 Code. Architecture and lifecycle constraints belong in the
[overview](./overview.md), not in these definitions.

## Workspace and conversation

| Term           | Meaning                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Environment    | One running server and the machine, credentials, workspace access, and state it owns.             |
| Client         | A web, desktop, or mobile UI connected to an environment. The desktop app can also host a server. |
| Project        | An environment-local workspace record rooted at a directory.                                      |
| Workspace root | The project's base filesystem directory on the environment.                                       |
| Worktree       | A separate Git checkout a thread can use instead of the project's main checkout.                  |
| Thread         | The durable conversation and work history for a project. It survives provider process exits.      |
| Turn           | One user-to-agent work cycle. Provider work can finish before checkpoint and diff work settles.   |
| Activity       | A non-message timeline item, such as a tool action, approval, or failure.                         |
| T3 home        | The base data directory. Runtime state normally lives under its `userdata` directory.             |

## Orchestration

| Term                    | Meaning                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Command                 | A request to change domain state. Accepting it does not mean its side effects have finished. |
| Event                   | A persisted fact produced by a command.                                                      |
| Decider                 | The pure logic that turns a command and current state into events.                           |
| Projection / read model | A view of current state derived from persisted events.                                       |
| Projector               | The logic that applies events to a read model.                                               |
| Reactor                 | A worker that performs follow-up work in response to recorded intent or runtime signals.     |
| Command receipt         | A durable record of a command's result, used to make retries idempotent.                     |
| Runtime receipt         | A test-only signal that an asynchronous milestone completed.                                 |
| Quiesced                | The relevant follow-up workers have finished, beyond the provider turn merely ending.        |

## Providers and checkpoints

| Term                | Meaning                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Provider            | The agent runtime T3 Code controls, such as Codex or Claude Code.                                            |
| Driver              | The integration for a provider kind.                                                                         |
| Provider instance   | One configured provider, with its own settings and lifecycle. Multiple instances can use the same driver.    |
| Adapter             | The boundary translating a provider's native protocol into T3 Code operations and events.                    |
| Session             | The provider runtime attached to a thread. A session can be stopped and resumed without deleting the thread. |
| Runtime mode        | The thread's permission policy. See [permission modes](../user/permission-modes.md).                         |
| Interaction mode    | How the agent approaches the task, such as planning. Separate from permission policy.                        |
| Checkpoint          | A saved workspace state used for diffs and restore, stored as a hidden Git ref.                              |
| Checkpoint baseline | The workspace state captured before the work being compared.                                                 |
| Turn diff           | The workspace changes attributed to one turn.                                                                |

## Pull requests

| Term                 | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pull request link    | A persisted thread association identified by host, repository, and number. Links can cross projects within an environment and carry a server-maintained snapshot.                        |
| Pull request sync    | The reactor that refreshes each distinct linked review once per cadence and discovers native stack layers. Explicit refreshes and failed stack reads trigger another read.               |
| Current pull request | The link used by single-review controls and older clients. Open work takes precedence; a completed single chain points at its top layer. Unrelated terminal links use the latest update. |

## Circe product terms

The product layer this fork ships over the T3 foundation.

### Circe product

#### Circe

The canonical product name for this fork. Circe adds deterministic voice control, task navigation, multi-node routing, and spoken reports to the T3 coding foundation. Provider CLIs still do the coding work. See [Circe identity](./circe-identity.md).

#### Legacy T3 names

Names inherited from the foundation that are being renamed in phases: `T3CODE_*` settings, `t3code:*` storage keys, `t3code` URL schemes, and `@circe/*` package names. They are legacy identifiers, not a boundary. See [Circe identity](./circe-identity.md).

### Multi-device Circe

#### Node

A paired T3 environment, identified by its stable `EnvironmentId`. A node owns its projects, providers, threads, workspace, event store, and provider credentials. In the multi-node MVP, a node is the unit of execution and availability; a client label is presentation metadata and does not replace the identity. See [the Circe contracts][26] and [the client mesh][27].

#### Node preset

The installer-selected capability set for one Circe installation: Full, Controller, or Headless. A preset controls which workspace, voice, and execution capabilities are present; it is status metadata, not a second identity or a setup task the user must repeat inside the app.

#### Circe installation

The one user-facing Circe product installed on a device. It owns one launcher, uninstall entry, node directory, and lifecycle even when isolated helper processes provide execution.

#### Execution node

The node that actually owns and runs a Circe task. The execution node is carried by `TaskRef` and is authoritative for the provider process, workspace, thread, checkpoints, and continuation. A controller may be connected to another node, but a continuation never moves to that controller's node just because it is visible there.

#### Voice node

The node that owns a live conversation session for a Controller interaction. It may differ from the execution node and never gains project or provider authority from handling audio.

#### Live conversation

The GPT-Live speech-to-speech session a node mints with its stored API key. The renderer owns microphone and speaker media over WebRTC; the node never sends the key to a client. Delegated requests reuse the ordinary Director, grounding, and provider path.

#### Origin interaction

The stable client interaction identity that submitted a routed request. It is carried in `CirceRequestMetadata.origin` and copied to the resulting presentation event. Origin-directed live delivery lets the originating interaction receive speech; the durable T3 result remains in the authoritative thread for every reconnecting client.

#### Node-qualified reference

A cross-node identifier that includes the owning node instead of relying on a locally unique ID. `ProjectRef` is `{ nodeId, projectId }`; `TaskRef` is `{ executionNodeId, threadId }`. The server validates the node portion before dispatch and rejects mismatches rather than guessing or falling back.

#### Environment registry

The client-runtime catalog and lifecycle owner for paired environments. `EnvironmentRegistry` persists connection targets and credentials, supervises connect/reconnect state, routes an operation to one environment, and removes its local cache when a saved environment is removed. It is a client-side directory, not a central Circe authority.

#### Desktop use

The in-house capability that lets a node capture its own display and inject pointer and keyboard events. A node drives only the machine it runs on; there is no cloud or virtual-desktop execution path. Agents reach it through the `t3-code` MCP toolkit and controllers reach it through the `desktopUse.*` WebSocket RPCs. See [desktop-use.md](./desktop-use.md).

#### Multi-node catalog

The client-side presentation of per-node project and provider reads. Catalog entries retain their node reference and label. Equal names are grouped as separate candidates and require clarification; provider readiness is reported from the node that owns the provider.

#### Circe controller

The provider-neutral server controller that resolves a user's requested provider, model, effort, and objective before emitting ordinary orchestration commands. It is not a provider and does not run its own manager model. See [circe-controller.md][25].

#### Decision tier

The TypeSafe System One classifier behind `CirceDecision`. It answers a map of finite questions over supplied catalogs: the model only selects an element of a finite set or evaluates a boolean predicate. The host derives every span, ID, sequence, and spoken line in code, so the proposal contains catalog names rather than internal IDs and has no dispatch or approval authority. The ordinary provider proposal remains only as a decline safety net. See [circe-controller.md][25].

#### Presentation event

An ephemeral, origin-directed summary of a Circe-managed thread's actual final output, question, approval request, or failure. It is projected live from durable T3 events and is never replayed or acknowledged. See [circe-controller.md][25].

#### Assistant delivery mode

Controls how assistant text reaches the thread timeline. In [the contracts][1], `streaming` updates incrementally and `buffered` accumulates text. Buffered delivery is not held until the turn completes: it spills once accumulated text would exceed 24,000 characters, and flushes at approval and user-input boundaries. See [ProviderRuntimeIngestion.ts][5].

#### Checkpoint ref

The durable identifier for a filesystem checkpoint, stored as a Git ref. It is typed in [the contracts][1], constructed in [Utils.ts][22], and used by [CheckpointStore.ts][19].

#### Checkpoint diff

The patch difference between two checkpoints. Query logic lives in [CheckpointDiffQuery.ts][20], diff parsing lives in [Diffs.ts][23], and finalization is coordinated by [CheckpointReactor.ts][6].

#### Aggregate

The domain object a command or event belongs to. In [the contracts][1], that is usually `project` or `thread`. See [decider.ts][8].

#### Domain Event

A persisted fact that something already happened. In [the contracts][1], events are the source of truth, and [projector.ts][4] shows how they are applied.
Examples include `thread.created`, `thread.message-sent`, and `thread.turn-diff-completed`.

#### Projection

A read-optimized view derived from events. See [projector.ts][4], [ProjectionPipeline.ts][11], and [ProjectionSnapshotQuery.ts][10].

#### Projector

The logic that applies domain events to the read model or projection tables. See [projector.ts][4] and [ProjectionPipeline.ts][11].

#### Read model

The current materialized view of orchestration state. In [the contracts][1], it holds projects, threads, messages, activities, checkpoints, and session state. See [ProjectionSnapshotQuery.ts][10] and [OrchestrationEngine.ts][7].

#### Receipt

A typed signal emitted when an async milestone completes, such as `checkpoint.baseline.captured`, `checkpoint.diff.finalized`, or `turn.processing.quiesced`. Receipts are a test-only mechanism: the production `RuntimeReceiptBusLive` publish is a no-op and only the test layer is PubSub-backed. Do not build production behavior on them. See [RuntimeReceiptBus.ts][13] and [CheckpointReactor.ts][6].

#### Snapshot

A point-in-time view of state. The word is used in multiple layers, including orchestration, provider, and checkpointing. See [ProjectionSnapshotQuery.ts][10], [ProviderAdapter.ts][15], and [CheckpointStore.ts][19].

#### Model manifest

The per-driver list of current model slugs that decides which models land in the model picker's legacy section. Bundled at `apps/server/src/provider/model-manifest.json` and refreshed at runtime from the same file on `main`, so classification updates ship as commits instead of releases. See the [provider architecture][16] model manifest section.
