# Headless Node Release

> For maintainers. User setup is documented in [Headless Node](../user/headless-node.md).

The headless Linux artifact is a self-contained tarball containing:

- the built server only (the web client is intentionally excluded from this no-UI artifact);
- the production dependency tree produced by `pnpm deploy --prod`;
- a matching Linux Node executable;
- the pinned-runtime launcher and service state;
- a `headless` capability manifest and preset;
- install, status, and uninstall helpers plus a user systemd unit template.

The deterministic artifact names are:

```text
Circe-Headless-Node-<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz
Circe-Headless-Node-<version>-linux-arm64.tar.gz
```

## Build on Linux

Build the web and server first, then package the host architecture:

```sh
vp run --filter @absterrg0/circe build
pnpm run package:headless:linux:x64
```

The script runs `pnpm deploy --prod --legacy` for the `circe` package, stages it under the pinned
runtime layout, removes the web client, source maps, and the server source directory, and creates a
sorted tarball with normalized timestamps and ownership. It also writes two files beside the
tarball: a `<artifact>.sha256` checksum and a `<artifact>.provenance.json` record containing the
source commit, release version, Linux architecture, bundled Node version, artifact name, and
artifact SHA-256. The archive manifest contains the same source commit, so provenance remains
available after the sidecars are separated from an uploaded artifact. It does not read or write the
live `~/.t3` userdata.

The `Headless Node release` workflow performs this build from clean checkouts on native Linux
runners: x64 uses `ubuntu-24.04` and arm64 uses `ubuntu-24.04-arm`. Each job runs the focused
packaging tests, rejects UI/source/source-map payloads and unsafe symlinks, starts the bundled CLI
with isolated state, and exercises install/update/uninstall with a fake user `systemctl` while
checking that userdata survives. It uploads the archive, checksum, and provenance for its native
architecture; the release coordinator publishes both deterministic artifacts. An x64 deployment
is never relabeled as arm64.

For a manually supplied arm64 artifact outside the release workflow, run the package step on an
arm64 Linux builder (or provide both a target Node executable and a `--deploy-dir` produced with
target-architecture production dependencies):

```sh
node scripts/package-headless-node.ts \
  --arch arm64 \
  --node-executable /path/to/linux-arm64/node \
  --node-version v24.13.1 \
  --deploy-dir /path/to/linux-arm64/t3-deploy
```

The script intentionally refuses to label an x64 host deployment as arm64. Native dependencies
such as `node-pty` must be built for the target architecture. A cross-arch Node executable alone is
not sufficient.

## Inspect and smoke-test an artifact

Use a temporary directory and an isolated home; never install a test artifact into a maintainer's
live home or start it against live T3 data:

```sh
artifact=release/Circe-Headless-Node-0.0.34-linux-x64.tar.gz
tar -tzf "$artifact" | sed -n '1,80p'
tmp_home=$(mktemp -d)
tmp_root=$(mktemp -d)
HOME="$tmp_home" tar -xzf "$artifact" -C "$tmp_root"
HOME="$tmp_home" T3CODE_HEADLESS_HOME="$tmp_home/.circe-headless" \
  sh -n "$tmp_root"/*/install.sh
"$tmp_root"/*/node/bin/node -e 'console.log(process.arch, process.version)'
if tar -tzf "$artifact" | grep -Eq '(^|/)node_modules/@absterrg0/circe/(src(/|$)|dist/client(/|$)|dist/.*\.map$)'; then
  echo "headless artifact contains the T3 UI, T3 source, or T3 source map payload" >&2
  exit 1
fi
rm -rf "$tmp_home" "$tmp_root"
```

The focused contract test covers the manifest, pinned launcher paths, archive naming, helper
scripts, source-map removal, and production staging:

```sh
pnpm --dir scripts exec vp test run package-headless-node.test.ts
pnpm --filter @circe/scripts exec tsgo --noEmit
```

For a manually supplied cross-architecture build, pass the source commit explicitly when the
builder is not the checkout that produced the deploy directory:

```sh
node scripts/package-headless-node.ts \
  --arch arm64 \
  --node-executable /path/to/linux-arm64/node \
  --node-version v24.13.1 \
  --source-commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --deploy-dir /path/to/linux-arm64/t3-deploy
```
