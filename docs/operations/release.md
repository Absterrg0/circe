# Release Checklist

> For maintainers. Using T3 Code? See [docs/user](../user/).

This repository currently exposes two manual coordinators. `Release` (`release.yml`) publishes
`@absterrg0/circe` to npm before desktop artifacts and optional hosted deployments. `Circe core
release` (`circe-release.yml`) packages the Full/Headless installers described below. They have
separate concurrency groups; do not dispatch both for the same version.

## Voice release scope

Live conversation is the only voice path. The renderer owns microphone and speaker media over WebRTC; the node mints the GPT-Live session with its stored key. Headless artifacts have no voice capability. The local extraction model stays disabled until a candidate passes the frozen eval gate, and no candidate is eligible today: the Director runs the bounded parser, then the declining local tier, then at most one configured-supervisor call. See the controller doc for the gate and the rejected `v077-small-s7` result.

Prerequisites before the voice pass: a configured supervisor provider on the semantic node, microphone permission on the capture device, system audio output available, and a stored live-conversation key on the node under test. Disabled voice clients stay idle with no presentation subscription.

CI and synthetic tests validate wiring and package topology only. They cannot validate physical hardware, OS microphone permissions, or device routing. Release candidates require a short real-device acceptance pass. Do not claim cross-platform readiness from mocked tests.

Visible copy says Circe. Installed IDs stay as shipped. See [Circe identity](../internals/circe-identity.md).

## Circe core release (staging first)

The Circe desktop macOS arm64/x64 DMG artifacts, Windows setup, and headless artifacts are
released together by
`.github/workflows/circe-release.yml`. Dispatch it manually from the current `main` branch with
the exact `X.Y.Z` version in both `apps/desktop/package.json` and `apps/server/package.json`. The
published release body includes the install matrix and checksum/provenance verification instructions
for these artifacts.

The coordinator first verifies the dispatch ref, `origin/main` commit, package versions, and channel
tag identity, then runs the four reusable build workflows
in parallel. Choose `stable` (the default)
for a signed production release or `preview` for an unsigned GitHub prerelease. Preview tags are
deterministic for a workflow run: `vX.Y.Z-preview.<run_number>`, and are never marked latest.
Stable tags remain `vX.Y.Z` and are marked latest. The staged release transaction owns draft recovery,
asset upload, remote audit, and publication by immutable release ID. Component workflows support
`workflow_call` and manual debugging only; they do not respond to stable tags or mutate GitHub
Releases.

The coordinator passes `public_release: true` only for stable builds. Stable gates run before
dependency installation and require complete Windows and base Apple signing/notarization
credentials; an incomplete set fails immediately. Preview builds pass `public_release: false`, skip
those credential preflights, publish an explicit unsigned warning in the prerelease body, and are
never latest. Manual component `workflow_dispatch` runs also default to `public_release: false`, so
they can produce unsigned debug builds for packaging, resource, and startup verification. Public Windows builds
pass `--signed` to the desktop artifact builder, sign the outer setup, and verify Authenticode
status and the configured publisher on both the setup executable and the installed
`desktop\\Circe.exe` before upload. Public macOS builds similarly require signed/stapled output.
Before upload the macOS workflow verifies the mounted DMG's bundle identity,
hardened-runtime signature, Gatekeeper assessment,
notarization ticket stapling, and an exact event-driven startup receipt (`version`, `platform`,
and `phase`). Signed macOS builds also require either `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` or
`CLERK_PASSKEY_RP_DOMAINS`; this is checked before dependency installation so a missing
passkey source cannot consume a full packaging run.

Before any release mutation, the coordinator downloads the exact Actions artifacts, restores the
`Circe-Setup.exe` alias, checks the exact filename set, SHA-256 sidecars, provenance versions,
provenance source commit, and artifact digests, then writes `SHA256SUMS`. Only after those checks
does the single promotion job create or reuse a draft release targeting the dispatch commit. A
retry reconciles that draft by immutable release ID: it retains an existing asset only when its
name, size, and `sha256:` digest exactly match one staged local asset; it deletes unexpected,
mismatched, and duplicate assets, then uploads only missing assets. The remote asset set is audited
exactly before publication and again after publication. A failed promotion must
leave a draft release for repair; do not delete it or create a stable tag manually.

Release checklist:

1. Confirm `main` contains the intended package versions. For `stable`, confirm the complete Apple
   signing/notarization and Azure Trusted Signing secret sets are present. The optional macOS
   passkey configuration is an all-or-none set and is not required for a Tailscale-first release.
   Dispatch the coordinator with the exact version and `channel=stable` or `channel=preview`.
2. Wait for all four build jobs and the local staging verifier to pass. The macOS jobs use native
   GitHub-hosted runners: arm64 uses `macos-15` and x64 uses `macos-15-intel`. They produce both
   arm64 and x64 DMG artifacts and fail closed if the target architecture does not match the
   runner. Do not copy upstream-only private runner labels into a fork.
3. If promotion fails, inspect the retained draft and rerun the same coordinator after correcting
   the cause. An unpublished draft may be retargeted by that retry when no existing tag points at a
   different commit; published releases and conflicting tags remain immutable. Never upload assets
   from a component workflow directly.
4. After publication, confirm the release contains the verified asset set plus `SHA256SUMS`. Stable
   releases are latest; preview releases are prereleases and must remain non-latest and visibly
   marked unsigned.

## Headless Node release

The dedicated `.github/workflows/headless-node-release.yml` workflow builds the Linux headless
archive, checksum, and provenance sidecars from the requested version in
`apps/server/package.json`. It supports reusable `workflow_call` and manual `workflow_dispatch`
invocations only; it has no stable tag trigger and never publishes a GitHub Release itself. The
Circe core coordinator downloads its verified 14-day Actions artifacts and owns the draft and
publication steps described above.

## Disabled upstream T3 release workflow (reference only)

The following sections describe `.github/workflows/release.yml`, the active npm and desktop
release graph adapted from T3 Code. It is manual-only.

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Triggers:
  - manual `workflow_dispatch` with `channel=stable`, the normal way to ship stable
  - push tag matching `v*.*.*` for a stable release of an explicit commit
  - scheduled nightly check every 30 minutes
  - manual `workflow_dispatch` with `channel=nightly`
- A manual stable release builds the commit of the latest published nightly, not `main` HEAD.
  Nightly is the release candidate: verify the nightly, then promote it. Merges to `main` keep
  landing while you verify and never leak into the stable build.
  - The version defaults to the one the nightly previewed (`0.0.39-nightly.*` ships as `0.0.39`).
    Pass the `version` input to override it, for example for a minor bump.
  - The stable tag is created on the nightly's commit when the GitHub Release is published.
  - Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag by hand still works and builds exactly the tagged commit. Use it when
    the commit to ship is not the latest nightly, such as a cherry-picked fix on a release branch.
- Runs lint, typecheck, and tests alongside artifact builds. Publishing waits for every check.
- Reads the shared production Circe Mesh relay URL and Clerk client configuration before packaging clients.
- Builds four artifacts in parallel for both channels:
  - macOS `arm64` DMG
  - macOS `x64` DMG
  - Linux `x64` AppImage
  - Windows `x64` NSIS installer
- Publishes one GitHub Release with all produced files.
  - Stable tags with a suffix after `X.Y.Z` (for example `1.2.3-alpha.1`) are published as GitHub prereleases.
  - Only plain stable `X.Y.Z` releases are marked as the repository's latest release.
  - Nightly runs are always GitHub prereleases and never marked latest.
  - Automatically generated release notes are pinned to the previous tag in the same channel, so stable compares to the previous stable tag and nightly compares to the previous nightly tag.
- Includes Electron auto-update metadata (for example `latest*.yml`, `nightly*.yml`, and `*.blockmap`) in release assets.
- Publishes the CLI package (`apps/server`, npm package `circe`) with OIDC trusted publishing from the same workflow file:
  - stable releases publish npm dist-tag `latest`
  - nightly releases publish npm dist-tag `nightly`
- Deploys the hosted web app to Vercel only after a release is published:
  - stable releases are aliased to the `latest` hosted app channel
  - nightly releases are aliased to the `nightly` hosted app channel

## Required release credentials

Stable releases require these GitHub Actions secrets in addition to the platform and deployment
credentials documented below:

- `RELEASE_APP_ID`
- `RELEASE_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`

The finalize job uses them to commit and push aligned package versions to `main` as the Release App.
GitHub Release publication uses the repository-scoped workflow token so it has a rate-limit quota
independent from the shared Release App installation.

## Circe Mesh relay deployment

The relay is a shared control plane versioned separately from client releases. Stable and nightly
client builds must point at the same relay so users see the same linked environments when switching
release channels.

`.github/workflows/deploy-relay.yml` deploys Alchemy stage `prod` on every push to `main`. The
release workflow reads the relay URL and Clerk client configuration from the existing `production`
GitHub Actions environment before building desktop, CLI, or hosted web artifacts.

Required repository variables shared by relay deployments:

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
- `PLANETSCALE_ORGANIZATION`
- `AXIOM_ORG_ID`

Required repository secrets shared by relay deployments:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- `PLANETSCALE_API_TOKEN_ID`
- `PLANETSCALE_API_TOKEN`
- `AXIOM_TOKEN`

Required `production` environment variables:

- `RELAY_API_ZONE_NAME`
- `RELAY_TUNNEL_ZONE_NAME`
- `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- `CLERK_JWT_AUDIENCE`
- `CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE`
- `CLERK_CLI_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- `APNS_ENVIRONMENT`
- `APNS_TEAM_ID`
- `APNS_KEY_ID`
- `APNS_BUNDLE_ID`

Optional `production` environment variables:

- `RELAY_DOMAIN` when overriding the derived `relay.<RELAY_API_ZONE_NAME>` domain

Required `production` environment secrets:

- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
- `APNS_PRIVATE_KEY`

The account-scoped repository credentials are consumed by Alchemy while provisioning relay stages; they
are not bound into the relay Worker. The production deployment uses an Axiom personal access token,
so `AXIOM_ORG_ID` must accompany `AXIOM_TOKEN`. The `prod` stage owns the retained PlanetScale
database. Local personal stages provision isolated branches from it and are never deployed by CI.
Production adopts the configured relay API and tunnel DNS zones as retained Cloudflare resources.
Personal stages reference the production-owned zones.

Developers deploy personal stages locally rather than through pull-request automation:

```sh
vp run --filter @circe/relay deploy -- --stage "$USER" --env-file .env.local
```

## Marketing site deployment

After a nightly release is published, the release workflow deploys the same commit
to the marketing site's Vercel production project. Stable releases do not deploy
the marketing site because they can promote an older nightly commit.

The job looks up the `t3code-marketing` project using the existing `VERCEL_TOKEN`
and `VERCEL_ORG_ID` secrets. It also respects the optional `VERCEL_TEAM_SLUG`
variable. The Vercel project's root directory must be `apps/marketing`.
Git deployments remain disabled in `apps/marketing/vercel.ts`.

## Hosted web app release deployment

The hosted app is intentionally not deployed by Vercel's Git integration. The
web project disables automatic Git deployments in `apps/web/vercel.ts` via
`git.deploymentEnabled: false`, and `.github/workflows/release.yml` deploys the
web app with Vercel CLI after the GitHub Release succeeds.

Required GitHub Actions secrets:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`

Optional GitHub Actions variables:

- `VERCEL_TEAM_SLUG`: overrides the Vercel CLI scope when the team slug is preferred over the `VERCEL_ORG_ID` secret.
- `CIRCE_WEB_ROUTER_URL`: defaults to `https://app.example.com`.
- `CIRCE_WEB_LATEST_DOMAIN`: defaults to `latest.app.example.com`.
- `CIRCE_WEB_NIGHTLY_DOMAIN`: defaults to `nightly.app.example.com`.

Required Vercel domains:

- `app.example.com`: the router domain users open, updated by stable releases.
- `latest.app.example.com`: channel alias updated by stable releases.
- `nightly.app.example.com`: channel alias updated by nightly releases.

The router domain uses `apps/web/vercel.ts` routes. Users opt into a channel by
visiting `/__t3code/channel?channel=latest` or
`/__t3code/channel?channel=nightly`; the router stores the
`t3code_web_channel` cookie and rewrites future requests on `app.example.com` to
the matching channel alias.

The release deploy job rewrites release package versions before upload so the
hosted app's About panel renders the release version. Stable deploys alias the
same deployment to both the `latest` channel and the router domain so the router
rules stay current. Nightly deploys only alias the `nightly` channel. The job
also passes `VITE_HOSTED_APP_CHANNEL=latest|nightly`, which renders the hosted
update track selector in the About panel. Changing the selector navigates
through `/__t3code/channel` on the router domain so the user's channel cookie is
updated before redirecting to the hosted app root.

One-time Vercel dashboard setup:

1. Confirm the web project root directory remains `apps/web`.
2. Add the three domains above to the web project.
3. Disable automatic Git deployments in the dashboard if desired; the committed
   `vercel.ts` setting is the source-of-truth, but disconnecting Git in the
   dashboard is also safe.
4. Run one stable release deployment, or manually alias the current stable
   deployment, so `app.example.com` points at a deployment containing the router
   rules in `apps/web/vercel.ts`. Future stable releases keep this alias current.

## Nightly builds

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Triggers:
  - scheduled check every 30 minutes
  - manual `workflow_dispatch` with `channel=nightly`
- Automatic nightlies require new commits and at least six hours since the last nightly was published, including manual nightlies.
- Manual nightlies bypass the time and change checks. Nightly runs remain serialized. Scheduled runs wait for an active nightly to finish, then check the publication gap before building.
- Runs the same desktop quality gates and artifact matrix as the tagged release flow.
- Publishes a GitHub prerelease only:
  - current tag format: `vX.Y.Z-nightly.YYYYMMDD.<run_number>`
  - `nightly-v...` is accepted only as a legacy previous-nightly tag
  - release name includes the short commit SHA
  - `make_latest` is always `false`
- Uses the next stable patch version as the nightly base. For example, `0.0.17` produces nightlies on `0.0.18-nightly.*`.
- Publishes Electron auto-update metadata to the dedicated `nightly` updater channel, so desktop users can opt into that track independently from stable.
- Publishes the CLI package (`apps/server`, npm package `circe`) to the `nightly` npm dist-tag using the same nightly version.
- Does not commit version bumps back to `main`.

## Server self-update release invariant

Connected servers update to the client's exact version, not to an npm dist-tag. Every released
desktop or hosted client version must therefore have a matching `@absterrg0/circe@<version>` package available on
npm before users can receive that client.

The workflow enforces this ordering:

1. `publish_cli` publishes the exact stable or nightly version to npm.
2. `release` depends on `publish_cli` before exposing desktop artifacts in GitHub Releases.
3. `deploy_web` depends on `release` before moving the hosted channel to the new client.

Preserve these dependencies when changing the release graph. Publishing a client first would leave
the **Update server** action targeting a package version that does not exist yet.

For a release smoke test, confirm `npm view @absterrg0/circe@<version> version` returns the expected version, then
connect the new client to a server on the previous version and verify that the update action
reconnects to the matching server. When the release adds database migrations, verify that the
remote update applies them and reconnects. A failed trial must restore the database snapshot and
restart the previous server. If the installed launcher does not support the target protocol,
verify that the update stops before restart and run `npx @absterrg0/circe@<version> service update` once on the
server machine. Also test the manual or desktop-managed guidance when those environments are
available.

## Desktop auto-update notes

Automatic download and install for official Circe Full releases are disabled: the desktop
runtime reports that ownership belongs to Circe Releases, and Circe Full never installs an
update on its own. The client still checks for updates on a startup delay plus interval and
offers a manual download/install button in the desktop UI; the DMG remains the macOS
install artifact. Circe Full does not publish or consume its own updater manifests or ZIP
payloads beyond what the nightly updater release carries for those manual checks.

- Updater runtime: `apps/desktop/src/updates/DesktopUpdates.ts`.
- `electron-updater` adapter: `apps/desktop/src/electron/ElectronUpdater.ts`.
- `apps/desktop/src/main.ts` only wires the updater layers into the desktop runtime.
- Update UX:
  - Background checks run on startup delay + interval.
  - No automatic download or install.
  - The desktop UI shows a rocket update button when an update is available; click once to download, click again after download to restart/install.
- Provider: GitHub Releases (`provider: github`) configured at build time.
- Repository slug source:
  - `CIRCE_DESKTOP_UPDATE_REPOSITORY` (format `owner/repo`), if set.
  - otherwise `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` from GitHub Actions.
- Historical upstream updater assets (not published by Circe Full):
  - platform installers (`.exe`, `.dmg`, and `.AppImage`)
  - channel metadata: `latest*.yml` for stable releases, `nightly*.yml` for nightly releases
  - `*.blockmap` files (used for differential downloads)
- macOS metadata note:
  - Circe Full does not publish macOS updater ZIPs or macOS updater manifests. Its signed and stapled DMG is the macOS release/install artifact.

### Windows payload topology and update validation

Windows packages the bundled server and only its runtime-external/native
dependency closure in `resources/server.asar`. Native modules and helper
executables declared as unpacked by that archive must be present at the matching
paths below `resources/server.asar.unpacked`. The Windows-native backend reads
the archive in place through Electron. Packaged Windows builds also ship a
Linux-only `resources/wsl-runtime.tar.gz` plus its SHA-256 sidecar. WSL verifies
and extracts that archive into `~/.t3/wsl-runtime/sha256-<archive-digest>` inside
the selected distro, then reuses it for later launches of the same update. The
Windows-side `wsl-server-tree/<version>` extraction remains a fallback and is
removed after the distro-local runtime passes preflight.

Windows keeps JavaScript and package metadata inside `app.asar` and unpacks only
native libraries and helper executables. Avoid enabling whole-package smart
unpacking: each loose file adds work to NSIS installation and counts against
the payload limit.

The artifact builder rejects a Windows package when any of these invariants
break:

- `resources/server.asar` is absent or does not contain the server entry.
- Any file marked unpacked in the ASAR header is absent from
  `resources/server.asar.unpacked`.
- On same-architecture Windows builds, the packaged primary cannot load the fff
  native library from inside `server.asar` through its `.unpacked` sibling.
- The isolated, extracted sidecar cannot load the server entry with plain Node.
- A Windows build with a WSL node-pty prebuild omits the WSL archive or SHA-256
  sidecar, the sidecar digest does not match the emitted archive, or required
  Linux runtime members are absent.
- The emitted WSL archive contains Windows/Darwin node-pty payloads, ConPTY,
  pnpm install metadata, or Windows-only FFF, ffi-rs, or msgpackr bindings.
- The external Windows resource monitor is absent.
- The loose Windows payload contains an unknown path. The allowlist covers Electron's runtime
  files, `resources/app.asar`, `resources/server.asar`, the resource monitor, and the exact
  unpacked file paths declared by the app/server ASAR headers.
- The Windows payload exceeds its byte budgets: 640 MiB total, or 256 MiB for either app/server
  ASAR. The validator records the deterministic loose-file manifest and file count as telemetry;
  the count is not a release gate.

Cross-architecture Windows builds retain every structural and extracted-sidecar
check, but skip executing the target Electron binary. A same-architecture build
for each release target must exercise the primary native-load probe.

NSIS differential packaging remains enabled. A sidecar layout transition can
produce a larger one-time download; subsequent small releases retain their
blockmaps, with a 60 MB maximum for a representative sidecar-to-sidecar update.

## 0) npm OIDC trusted publishing setup (CLI)

Configure Trusted Publisher on the npm package **`@absterrg0/circe`**. The unscoped `circe`
package belongs to another project. Enter these case-sensitive values:

- Provider: GitHub Actions
- Organization or user: `Absterrg0`
- Repository: `circe`
- Workflow filename: `release.yml` (no `.github/workflows/` prefix)
- Environment: leave empty; the publishing job does not declare one

The publishing job uses npm 11.11.0 and `id-token: write`. The CLI prepares concrete package
metadata in `apps/server` and invokes native `npm publish` there. It restores the original
metadata and icons afterward.

There is no non-publishing dispatch mode; use normal CI or local quality gates to validate checks
and builds without shipping.

If npm reports `OIDC token exchange error - package not found` while `npm view @absterrg0/circe`
succeeds, inspect the saved publisher fields before rerunning a build. npm does not validate those
fields when they are saved.

## 1) Release validation and unsigned builds

There is no dry-run tag path. Pushing any accepted non-nightly tag, including
`v0.0.0-test.1`, classifies the run as the stable channel. It publishes `circe` with npm dist-tag
`latest`, creates a real GitHub Release, aliases the hosted app to `latest.app.example.com` and
`app.example.com`, and can commit a version bump to `main` in the finalize job. Do not push a test tag
to validate the workflow.

The workflow has no non-publishing dispatch mode. Use normal CI or local quality gates to
validate checks and builds without shipping. To exercise the complete release graph at lower stable
risk, manually dispatch `channel=nightly`; this still publishes a real nightly npm package, GitHub
prerelease, desktop updater release, hosted nightly alias, and marketing site, but it does not update stable app aliases or
commit a version bump to `main`. Only run it when a real nightly release is acceptable.

Manual `channel=stable` is also a real stable-channel release in the upstream workflow.
Omitting signing secrets there only makes platform artifacts unsigned; it does not prevent
publication. Circe does not inherit that rule:

The core workflow has no non-publishing `workflow_dispatch` mode. Use component workflow manual
dispatches (including the macOS workflow with its default `public_release: false`) or local quality
gates to validate checks and builds without shipping. To exercise the complete release graph at lower
stable risk, manually dispatch `channel=nightly`; this still publishes a real nightly npm package,
GitHub prerelease, desktop updater release, and hosted nightly alias, but it does not update stable
aliases or commit a version bump to `main`. Only run it when a real nightly release is acceptable.

Manual `channel=stable` with a version input is also a real stable-channel release. Omitting signing
secrets fails the public release before artifact publication. Local unsigned builds remain possible
by invoking the artifact builder without `--signed`, but they are not release inputs.

## 2) Apple signing + notarization setup (macOS)

Stable Circe builds require these base signing/notarization secrets:

- `CSC_LINK`
- `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_API_KEY`
- `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`
- `APPLE_API_ISSUER`

The optional native passkey set is enabled only when all of the following are supplied:

- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`
- `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE` (base64-encoded provisioning profile with Associated Domains)
- either `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` or `CLERK_PASSKEY_RP_DOMAINS`

The passkey values are all-or-none. A signed macOS build without them still receives the base
Electron entitlements and can be released over Tailscale; it simply does not claim native Clerk
passkey support. Live conversation still requires the real-device microphone checklist below. Preview releases do not require signing credentials.

Optional repository variables for the passkey set:

- `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: production Clerk publishable key used to derive the passkey RP domain.
- `CLERK_PASSKEY_RP_DOMAINS`: comma-separated RP-domain override. By default, the build derives the
  domain from `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.

Checklist:

1. Apple Developer account access:
   - Team has rights to create Developer ID certificates.
2. When native passkeys are required, create an explicit App ID for `com.abstergo.circe` and
   enable Associated Domains.
3. Create a `Developer ID Application` certificate and a compatible provisioning profile for that
   App ID with Associated Domains enabled.
4. Export the certificate + private key as `.p12` from Keychain.
5. Base64-encode the `.p12` and store as `CSC_LINK`.
6. If enabling passkeys, base64-encode the provisioning profile and store it as
   `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`.
7. Store the `.p12` export password as `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, and set `APPLE_TEAM_ID` to the
   10-character Apple Developer Team ID.
8. In App Store Connect, create an API key (Team key).
9. Add API key values:
   - `APPLE_API_KEY`: contents of the downloaded `.p8`
   - `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`: Key ID
   - `APPLE_API_ISSUER`: Issuer ID
10. If enabling passkeys, complete the Clerk Native API and AASA setup in [Circe Mesh setup](./mesh-setup.md#desktop-passkeys).
11. Dispatch the Circe coordinator with `channel=stable` and confirm macOS artifacts are
    signed/notarized. When passkeys are configured, also confirm the expected
    `com.apple.developer.associated-domains` entitlement.

Notes:

- `APPLE_API_KEY` is stored as raw key text in secrets.
- The workflow writes it to a temporary `AuthKey_<id>.p8` file at runtime.
- When configured, the workflow decodes `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`.
  It validates the profile with `security cms` and passes it to the desktop packager.

## 3) Azure Trusted Signing setup (Windows)

Required secrets used by the workflow:

- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_ACCOUNT_NAME`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE_PROFILE_NAME`
- `AZURE_TRUSTED_SIGNING_PUBLISHER_NAME`

Checklist:

1. Create Azure Trusted Signing account and certificate profile.
2. Record ATS values:
   - Endpoint
   - Account name
   - Certificate profile name
   - Publisher name
3. Create/choose an Entra app registration (service principal).
4. Grant service principal permissions required by Trusted Signing.
5. Create a client secret for the service principal.
6. Add Azure secrets listed above in GitHub Actions secrets.
7. Dispatch the Circe core coordinator and confirm the Windows installer and installed
   `desktop\\Circe.exe` report Authenticode `Valid` with the configured publisher.

## 4) Ongoing release checklist

1. Pick the latest nightly and verify it: run the smoke test above against its artifacts and
   check the nightly channel for regressions.
2. Dispatch the Release workflow with `channel=stable`. Leave `version` empty unless the version
   should differ from the one the nightly previewed.
3. Confirm the `Resolve release commit` notice names the nightly tag and commit you verified. If a
   newer nightly published in between, the run builds that one instead.
4. Verify workflow steps:
   - preflight passes
   - release quality checks pass
   - all matrix builds pass
   - `publish_cli` publishes the exact release version before the release job
   - release job uploads expected files
5. Smoke test downloaded artifacts.

## 5) Troubleshooting

- macOS build unsigned when expected signed:
  - Check all five base Apple secrets are populated and non-empty.
  - If native passkeys are intended, check the complete optional set: `APPLE_TEAM_ID`,
    `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`, and `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` or `CLERK_PASSKEY_RP_DOMAINS`.
  - Confirm the provisioning profile belongs to `APPLE_TEAM_ID.com.abstergo.circe` and includes
    Associated Domains.
- Windows build unsigned when expected signed:
  - Check all Azure ATS and auth secrets are populated and non-empty.
  - Confirm the coordinator passed `public_release: true`; partial secret sets are rejected.
- Build fails with signing error:
  - Retry with secrets removed to confirm unsigned path still works.
  - Re-check certificate/profile names and tenant/client credentials.
